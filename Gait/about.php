            <h1> About Us </h1>
            <hr>
            <p style="float: left;">There is a gigantic number of people that spend a large sum of money on games and gaming products. Hence there is a huge market for items like gaming cards, game pads, mouse, keyboards etc. With so many options to choose from, it gets difficult to narrow down our choices that fit best with our requirements. More often than not, it is a tedious, research extensive process.</p>
            
            <p>The solution to the problem is GAIT. The objective of this project is to create a web application that helps the user to choose the right product according to their preference. This cuts down on the time-consuming work put into searching the whole internet and asking around for reviews that would ultimately affect your purchase decision. GPR will host a vast collection of gaming products with their details and authentic reviews by users. It will also include ratings for every item. This allows other users to fill in their requirements, including the budget and discover the best option for them based on user reviews. </p>
           
            <p>Moreover, there will be option for premium memberships. User can pay a subscription fee to get special features such as advertising their own product etc. </p>
